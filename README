                     Common Lisp Namespace Server


This project aims to replicate the namespace servers present on many
Lisp Machines (e.g. Symbolics, LMI, TI et al).

Rather than working on the basis of a `distribution', CL-NAMESPACE
works on the basis of a `system.'

This is still a work-in-progress.
